some datascience projects i have worked on 
This repository contains data science projects focusing on classification, regression, and predictive modeling. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, I explored the Titanic, Iris, and IMDb datasets to derive insights and build models. The projects cover data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and model evaluation.
